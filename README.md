## Description
The project is focused around webpack, and its configuration steps. It is written in TypeScript which is transpiled into JavaScript by webpack. Other loaders also are used such as `html-loader`, `css-loader`, `file-loader`, and `style-loader`. Webpack bundles all source files and builds them into /dist directory. Players must select two cards each time to finally have all game cards paired together.
